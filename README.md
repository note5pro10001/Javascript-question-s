1. ### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

   There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below

   1. **Object constructor:**

      The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

      ```javascript
      var object = new Object();
      ```

   2. **Object's create method:**

      The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

      ```javascript
      var object = Object.create(null);
      ```

   3. **Object literal syntax:**

      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
           name: "Sudheer"
           age: 34
      };

      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.
      ```

      **Note:** This is an easiest way to create an object

   4. **Function constructor:**

      Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

      ```javascript
      function Person(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 21;
      }
      var object = new Person("Sudheer");
      ```

   5. **Function constructor with prototype:**

      This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

      ```javascript
      function Person() {}
      Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
      var object = new Person();
      ```

      This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

      ```javascript
      function func() {};

      new func(x, y, z);
      ```

      **(OR)**

      ```javascript
      // Create a new instance using function prototype.
      var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

      // Call the function
      var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

      // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
      console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
      ```

   6. **ES6 Class syntax:**

      ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects

      ```javascript
      class Person {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      }

      var object = new Person("Sudheer");
      ```

   7. **Singleton pattern:**

      A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

      ```javascript
      var object = new (function () {
        this.name = "Sudheer";
      })();
      ```

      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

2. ### What is a prototype chain

   **Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.

   The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or \***\*proto\*\*** property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through **Object.prototype**.

   ![Screenshot](images/prototype_chain.png)

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

3. ### What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind

   The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

   **Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one

   ```javascript
   var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
   var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
     console.log(
       greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
     );
   }

   invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
   invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
   ```

   **Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

   ```javascript
   var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
   var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
     console.log(
       greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
     );
   }

   invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
   invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
   ```

   **bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

   ```javascript
   var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
   var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
     console.log(
       greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
     );
   }

   var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
   var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
   inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
   inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
   ```

   Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.

   Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().

4. ### What is JSON and its common operations

   **JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json

   **Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object

   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(text);
   ```

   **Stringification:** converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network

   ```javascript
   JSON.stringify(object);
   ```

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

5. ### What is the purpose of the array slice method

   The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end.

   Some of the examples of this method are,

   ```javascript
   let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
   ```

   **Note:** Slice method won't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

6. ### What is the purpose of the array splice method

   The **splice()** method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.

   Some of the examples of this method are,

   ```javascript
   let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
   ```

   **Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.

7. ### What is the difference between slice and splice

   Some of the major difference in a tabular form

   | Slice                                        | Splice                                          |
   | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
   | Doesn't modify the original array(immutable) | Modifies the original array(mutable)            |
   | Returns the subset of original array         | Returns the deleted elements as array           |
   | Used to pick the elements from array         | Used to insert or delete elements to/from array |

8. ### How do you compare Object and Map

   **Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.

   1. The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
   2. The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
   3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
   4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
   5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
   6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

9. ### What is the difference between == and === operators

   JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

   1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
   2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
      There are two special cases in this,
      1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
      2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
   3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
   4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
   5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e,
      null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

   Some of the example which covers the above cases,

   ```javascript
   0 == false   // true
   0 === false  // false
   1 == "1"     // true
   1 === "1"    // false
   null == undefined // true
   null === undefined // false
   '0' == false // true
   '0' === false // false
   []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
   {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
   ```

10. ### What are lambda or arrow functions

    An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

11. ### What is a first class function

    In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

    For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener

    ```javascript
    const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
    document.addEventListener("click", handler);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

12. ### What is a first order function

    First-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value.

    ```javascript
    const firstOrder = () => console.log("I am a first order function!");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What is a higher order function

    Higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.

    ```javascript
    const firstOrderFunc = () =>
      console.log("Hello, I am a First order function");
    const higherOrder = (ReturnFirstOrderFunc) => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
    higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
    ```

14. ### What is a unary function

    Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. It stands for a single argument accepted by a function.

    Let us take an example of unary function,

    ```javascript
    const unaryFunction = (a) => console.log(a + 10); // Add 10 to the given argument and display the value
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

15. ### What is the currying function

    Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.

    Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,

    ```javascript
    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
    console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
    curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6
    ```

    Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** and **functional composition**.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

16. ### What is a pure function

    A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.

    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

    ```javascript
    //Impure
    let numberArray = [];
    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);
    //Pure
    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>
      argNumberArray.concat([number]);

    //Display the results
    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
    ```

    As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value. . Whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.

    Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

17. ### What is the purpose of the let keyword

    The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the `var` keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

    Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,

    ```javascript
    let counter = 30;
    if (counter === 30) {
      let counter = 31;
      console.log(counter); // 31
    }
    console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)
    ```

## Differences between declaring variables using var, let and const.

![Screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yj0O5G2RRrYK_d9qkEqQQg.png)

var variable1 = 23;

let variable2 = 89;

function catchValues(){
  console.log(variable1);
  console.log(variable2);

// Both the variables can be accessed anywhere since they are declared in the global scope
}

window.variable1; // Returns the value 23

window.variable2; // Returns undefined

--> The variables declared with the let keyword in the global scope behave just like the variable declared with the var keyword in the global scope.
--> Variables declared in the global scope with var and let keywords can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
--> But, there is one difference! Variables that are declared with the var keyword in the global scope are added to the window/global object. Therefore, they can be accessed using window.variableName.
Whereas, the variables declared with the let keyword are not added to the global object, therefore, trying to access such variables using window.variableName results in an error.

## const Keyword
--> Variables with the const keyword behave exactly like a variable declared with the let keyword with only one difference, any variable declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned.

const x = {name:"Vivek"};

x = {address: "India"}; // Throws an error

x.name = "Nikhil"; // No error is thrown

const y = 23;

y = 44; // Throws an error

18. ### What is the difference between let and var

    You can list out the differences in a tabular format

    | var                                                   | let                         |
    | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6   |
    | It has function scope                                 | It has block scope          |
    | Variables will be hoisted                             | Hoisted but not initialized |

    Let's take an example to see the difference,

    ```javascript
    function userDetails(username) {
      if (username) {
        console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
        console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
        let age = 30;
        var salary = 10000;
      }
      console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
      console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
    }
    userDetails("John");
    ```

19. ### What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword

    `let` is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming languages like **Scheme** and **Basic**. It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages that use `let` already as a traditional keyword as close to `var` as possible.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

20. ### How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error

    If you try to redeclare variables in a `switch block` then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,

    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
    switch (x) {
      case 0:
        let name;
        break;

      case 1:
        let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
        break;
    }
    ```

    To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical environment.

    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
    switch (x) {
      case 0: {
        let name;
        break;
      }
      case 1: {
        let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
        break;
      }
    }
    ```

21. ### What is the Temporal Dead Zone

    The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

    Let's see this behavior with an example,

    ```javascript
    function somemethod() {
      console.log(counter1); // undefined
      console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
      var counter1 = 1;
      let counter2 = 2;
    }
    ```

22. ### What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

    IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      // logic here
    })();
    ```

    The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      var message = "IIFE";
      console.log(message);
    })();
    console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


24. ### What is memoization

    Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

    ```javascript
    const memoizAddition = () => {
      let cache = {};
      return (value) => {
        if (value in cache) {
          console.log("Fetching from cache");
          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
        } else {
          console.log("Calculating result");
          let result = value + 20;
          cache[value] = result;
          return result;
        }
      };
    };
    // returned function from memoizAddition
    const addition = memoizAddition();
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
    ```

25. ### What is Hoisting

    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
    Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

    ```javascript
    console.log(message); //output : undefined
    var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
    ```

    The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

    ```javascript
    var message;
    console.log(message);
    message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
    ```

    In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too

    ```javascript
    message("Good morning"); //Good morning

    function message(name) {
      console.log(name);
    }
    ```

    This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

26. ### What are classes in ES6

    In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.
    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

    ```javascript
    function Bike(model, color) {
      this.model = model;
      this.color = color;
    }

    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
      return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
    };
    ```

    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

    ```javascript
    class Bike {
      constructor(color, model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
      }

      getDetails() {
        return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
      }
    }
    ```

27. ### What are closures

    A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains

    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
    2. Outer function’s variables
    3. Global variables

    Let's take an example of closure concept,

    ```javascript
    function Welcome(name) {
      var greetingInfo = function (message) {
        console.log(message + " " + name);
      };
      return greetingInfo;
    }
    var myFunction = Welcome("John");
    myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
    myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John
    ```

    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

28. ### What are modules

    Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29. ### Why do you need modules

    Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem

    1. Maintainability
    2. Reusability
    3. Namespacing

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

30. ### What is scope in javascript

    Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

31. ### What is a service worker

    A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

32. ### How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker

    Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

35. ### What is web storage

    Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

    1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
    2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

36. ### What is a post message

    Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37. ### What is a Cookie

    A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
    For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John";
    ```

    ![Screenshot](images/cookie.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### Why do you need a Cookie

    Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

    1. When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
    2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


41. ### What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage

    Below are some of the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage,

    | Feature                           | Cookie                             | Local storage    | Session storage     |
    | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
    | Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side     | client-side only | client-side only    |
    | Lifetime                          | As configured using Expires option | until deleted    | until tab is closed |
    | SSL support                       | Supported                          | Not supported    | Not supported       |
    | Maximum data size                 | 4KB                                | 5 MB             | 5MB                 |

42. ### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage

    LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

43. ### How do you access web storage

    The Window object implements the `WindowLocalStorage` and `WindowSessionStorage` objects which has `localStorage`(window.localStorage) and `sessionStorage`(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local).
    For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

    ```javascript
    localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
    localStorage.getItem("logo");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

44. ### What are the methods available on session storage

    The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data

    ```javascript
    // Save data to sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

    // Get saved data from sessionStorage
    let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

    // Remove saved data from sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

    // Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
    sessionStorage.clear();
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

46. ### Why do you need web storage

    Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach than Cookies.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

47. ### How do you check web storage browser support

    You need to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage before using web storage,

    ```javascript
    if (typeof Storage !== "undefined") {
      // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
    } else {
      // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
    }
    ```

51. ### What is a promise

    A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

    The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      // promise description
    });
    ```

    The usage of a promise would be as below,

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(
      (resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve("I'm a Promise!");
        }, 5000);
      },
      (reject) => {}
    );

    promise.then((value) => console.log(value));
    ```

    The action flow of a promise will be as below,

    ![Screenshot](images/promises.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

52. ### Why do you need a promise

    Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53. ### What are the three states of promise

    Promises have three states:

    1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
    2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
    3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

54. ### What is a callback function

    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
    Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

    ```javascript
    function callbackFunction(name) {
      console.log("Hello " + name);
    }

    function outerFunction(callback) {
      let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
      callback(name);
    }

    outerFunction(callbackFunction);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### Why do we need callbacks

    The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

    ```javascript
    function firstFunction() {
      // Simulate a code delay
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("First function called");
      }, 1000);
    }
    function secondFunction() {
      console.log("Second function called");
    }
    firstFunction();
    secondFunction();

    Output;
    // Second function called
    // First function called
    ```

    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.

61. ### What are the main rules of promise

    A promise must follow a specific set of rules,

    1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
    2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
    3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
    4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

66. ### What is a strict mode in javascript

    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `"use strict";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67. ### Why do you need strict mode

    Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

69. ### What is the purpose of double exclamation

    The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, true.
    For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,

    ```javascript
    let isIE8 = false;
    isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
    console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
    ```

    If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.

    ```javascript
    console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null
    ```

    **Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

70. ### What is the purpose of the delete operator

    The delete keyword is used to delete the property as well as its value.

    ```javascript
    var user = { name: "John", age: 20 };
    delete user.age;

    console.log(user); // {name: "John"}
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

71. ### What is the typeof operator

    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.

    ```javascript
    typeof "John Abraham"; // Returns "string"
    typeof (1 + 2); // Returns "number"
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

72. ### What is undefined property

    The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

    ```javascript
    var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    console.log(typeof user); //undefined
    ```

    Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

    ```javascript
    user = undefined;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

73. ### What is null value

    The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object.
    You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

    ```javascript
    var user = null;
    console.log(typeof user); //object
    ```

74. ### What is the difference between null and undefined

    Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

    | Null                                                                                            | Undefined                                                                                               |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.                    | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
    | Type of null is object                                                                          | Type of undefined is undefined                                                                          |
    | The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.            |
    | Indicates the absence of a value for a variable                                                 | Indicates absence of variable itself                                                                    |
    | Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations                                     | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations                                                  |

75. ### What is eval

    The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string. The string can be a JavaScript expression, variable, statement, or sequence of statements.

    ```javascript
    console.log(eval("1 + 2")); //  3
    ```

76. ### What is the difference between window and document

    Below are the main differences between window and document,

    | Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                      |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
    | By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                            |
    | It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc              |

79. ### What is isNaN

    The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.

    ```javascript
    isNaN("Hello"); //true
    isNaN("100"); //false
    ```

80. ### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables

    Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) and undefined variables,

    | undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |
    | If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |

81. ### What are global variables

    Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable

    ```javascript
    msg = "Hello"; // var is missing, it becomes global variable
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

82. ### What are the problems with global variables

    The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

83. ### What is NaN property

    The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

    ```javascript
    Math.sqrt(-1);
    parseInt("Hello");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

86. ### What is event bubbling

    Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87. ### What is event capturing

    Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost DOM element.

88. ### How do you submit a form using JavaScript

    You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler

    ```javascript
    function submit() {
      document.forms[0].submit();
    }
    ```

92. ### What are the tools or techniques used for debugging JavaScript code

    You can use below tools or techniques for debugging javascript

    1. Chrome Devtools
    2. debugger statement
    3. Good old console.log statement

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94. ### What is the difference between an attribute and a property

    Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,

    ```javascript
    <input type="text" value="Name:">
    ```

    You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

    ```javascript
    const input = document.querySelector("input");
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good morning
    ```

    And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

    ```javascript
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
    console.log(input.value); // Good evening
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

96. ### What is the purpose of void 0

    Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML documents that use href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an `<a>` element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression.
    For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page

    ```javascript
    <a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">
      Click Me!
    </a>
    ```

97. ### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language

    JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

98. ### Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language

    Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

99. ### Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript

    No, they are entirely two different programming languages and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).

100. ### What are events

     Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

     1. Web page has finished loading
     2. Input field was changed
     3. Button was clicked

     Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

     ```javascript
     <!doctype html>
     <html>
      <head>
        <script>
          function greeting() {
            alert('Hello! Good morning');
          }
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
      </body>
     </html>
     ```

101. ### Who created javascript

     JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed under the name `Mocha`, but later the language was officially called `LiveScript` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.

102. ### What is the use of preventDefault method

     The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

     ```javascript
     document
       .getElementById("link")
       .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
         event.preventDefault();
       });
     ```

     **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

105. ### What is BOM

     The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

106. ### What is the use of setTimeout

     The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

     ```javascript
     setTimeout(function () {
       console.log("Good morning");
     }, 2000);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107. ### What is the use of setInterval

     The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

     ```javascript
     setInterval(function () {
       console.log("Good morning");
     }, 2000);
     ```

108. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

     JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

111. ### What is JSON

     JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

112. ### What are the syntax rules of JSON

     Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON

     1. The data is in name/value pairs
     2. The data is separated by commas
     3. Curly braces hold objects
     4. Square brackets hold arrays

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113. ### What is the purpose JSON stringify

     When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

     ```javascript
     var userJSON = { name: "John", age: 31 };
     var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);
     console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

114. ### How do you parse JSON string

     When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

     ```javascript
     var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
     var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
     console.log(userJSON); // {name: "John", age: 31}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

115. ### Why do you need JSON

     When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

117. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method

     The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

     For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearTimeout(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method

     The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.

     For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearInterval(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

119. ### How do you redirect new page in javascript

     In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     function redirect() {
       window.location.href = "newPage.html";
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

120. ### How do you check whether a string contains a substring

     There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

     1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       subString = "hell";
     mainString.includes(subString);
     ```

     1. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       subString = "hell";
     mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
     ```

     1. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       regex = /hell/;
     regex.test(mainString);
     ```

123. ### What are the various url properties of location object

     The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,

     1. href - The entire URL
     2. protocol - The protocol of the URL
     3. host - The hostname and port of the URL
     4. hostname - The hostname of the URL
     5. port - The port number in the URL
     6. pathname - The path name of the URL
     7. search - The query portion of the URL
     8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

125. ### How do you check if a key exists in an object

     You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

     1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

     ```javascript
     "key" in obj;
     ```

     and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

     ```javascript
     !("key" in obj);
     ```

     1. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

     ```javascript
     obj.hasOwnProperty("key"); // true
     ```

     1. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: "John",
     };

     console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true
     console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
     ```

126. ### How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object

     You can use the `for-in` loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using `hasOwnProperty` method.

     ```javascript
     var object = {
       k1: "value1",
       k2: "value2",
       k3: "value3",
     };

     for (var key in object) {
       if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
         console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
       }
     }
     ```

128. ### What is an arguments object

     The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,

     ```javascript
     function sum() {
       var total = 0;
       for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
         total += arguments[i];
       }
       return total;
     }

     sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
     ```

     **Note:** You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.

     ```javascript
     var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

129. ### How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase

     You can create a function which uses a chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with the first letter in uppercase.

     ```javascript
     function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
       return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

131. ### How do you display the current date in javascript

     You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

     ```javascript
     var today = new Date();
     var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
     var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
     var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

     today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;
     document.write(today);
     ```

135. ### How do you add a key value pair in javascript

     There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object. Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

     ```javascript
     var object = {
       key1: value1,
       key2: value2,
     };
     ```

     1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property

     ```javascript
     object.key3 = "value3";
     ```

     1. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined.

     ```javascript
     obj["key3"] = "value3";
     ```

136. ### Is the !-- notation represents a special operator

     No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

     1. A logical not (!)
     2. A prefix decrement (--)

     At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

137. ### How do you assign default values to variables

     You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

     ```javascript
     var a = b || c;
     ```

     As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

143. ### What are break and continue statements

     The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

     ```javascript
     for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i === 5) {
         break;
       }
       text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
     }
     ```

     The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

     ```javascript
     for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i === 5) {
         continue;
       }
       text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
     }
     ```

147. ### What are the recommendations to create new object

     It is recommended to avoid creating new objects using `new Object()`. Instead you can initialize values based on it's type to create the objects.

     1. Assign {} instead of new Object()
     2. Assign "" instead of new String()
     3. Assign 0 instead of new Number()
     4. Assign false instead of new Boolean()
     5. Assign [] instead of new Array()
     6. Assign /()/ instead of new RegExp()
     7. Assign function (){} instead of new Function()

     You can define them as an example,

     ```javascript
     var v1 = {};
     var v2 = "";
     var v3 = 0;
     var v4 = false;
     var v5 = [];
     var v6 = /()/;
     var v7 = function () {};
     ```

148. ### How do you define JSON arrays

     JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,

     ```javascript
     "users":[
       {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
       {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
       {"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}
     ]
     ```

149. ### How do you generate random integers

     You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,

     ```javascript
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     ```

     **Note:** Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

150. ### Can you write a random integers function to print integers with in a range

     Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)

     ```javascript
     function randomInteger(min, max) {
       return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
     }
     randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000
     ```

155. ### What are the string methods available in Regular expression

     Regular Expressions has two string methods: search() and replace().
     The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
     ```

     The replace() method is used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.replace(/John/i, "Buttler"); // Hello Buttler
     ```

158. ### What is a RegExp object

     RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. Let's see the simple usage of RegExp object,

     ```javascript
     var regexp = new RegExp("\\w+");
     console.log(regexp);
     // expected output: /\w+/
     ```

161. ### How do you change the style of a HTML element

     You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript

     1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
     ```

     1. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
     ```

162. ### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'

     The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`.

164. ### What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging

     You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is executed and the debugger window pops up. At each breakpoint, javascript will stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code using the play button.

165. ### Can I use reserved words as identifiers

     No, you cannot use the reserved words as variables, labels, object or function names. Let's see one simple example,

     ```javascript
     var else = "hello"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token else
     ```

172. ### What are the properties used to get size of window

     You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

     ```javascript
     var width =
       window.innerWidth ||
       document.documentElement.clientWidth ||
       document.body.clientWidth;

     var height =
       window.innerHeight ||
       document.documentElement.clientHeight ||
       document.body.clientHeight;
     ```

173. ### What is a conditional operator in javascript

     The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for if statements.

     ```javascript
     var isAuthenticated = false;
     console.log(
       isAuthenticated ? "Hello, welcome" : "Sorry, you are not authenticated"
     ); //Sorry, you are not authenticated
     ```

178. ### What is a freeze method

     The **freeze()** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e, It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       prop: 100,
     };

     Object.freeze(obj);
     obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

     console.log(obj.prop); //100
     ```

     **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

179. ### What is the purpose of freeze method

     Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

     1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180. ### Why do I need to use freeze method

     In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

184. ### What are various operators supported by javascript

     An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

     1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition),– (Subtraction), \* (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), + + (Increment) and – – (Decrement)
     2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes = =(Equal),!= (Not Equal), ===(Equal with type), > (Greater than),> = (Greater than or Equal to),< (Less than),<= (Less than or Equal to)
     3. **Logical Operators:** Includes &&(Logical AND),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)
     4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), – = (Subtract and Assignment Operator), \*= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
     5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
     6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

185. ### What is a rest parameter

     Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
       // ...
     }
     ```

     For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

     ```javascript
     function total(…args){
     let sum = 0;
     for(let i of args){
     sum+=i;
     }
     return sum;
     }
     console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
     console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
     ```

     **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

187. ### What are the bitwise operators available in javascript

     Below are the list of bitwise logical operators used in JavaScript

     1. Bitwise AND ( & )
     2. Bitwise OR ( | )
     3. Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
     4. Bitwise NOT ( ~ )
     5. Left Shift ( << )
     6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )
     7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )

188. ### What is a spread operator

     Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

     ```javascript
     function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
       return x + y + z;
     }

     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

     console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
     ```

189. ### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not

     Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,

     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If all its data properties are non-writable.
        The usage is going to be as follows,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Welcome JS world",
     };
     Object.freeze(object);
     console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

190. ### How do you determine two values same or not using object

     The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

     ```javascript
     Object.is("hello", "hello"); // true
     Object.is(window, window); // true
     Object.is([], []); // false
     ```

     Two values are the same if one of the following holds:

     1. both undefined
     2. both null
     3. both true or both false
     4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
     5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)
     6. both numbers and
        both +0
        both -0
        both NaN
        both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

214. ### What is an anonymous function

     An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function (optionalParameters) {
       //do something
     }

     const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
       //do something
     };

     [1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
       //do something
     });
     ```

     Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,

     ```javascript
     var x = function (a, b) {
       return a * b;
     };
     var z = x(5, 10);
     console.log(z); // 50
     ```

215. ### What is the precedence order between local and global variables

     A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Good morning";
     function greeting() {
       msg = "Good Evening";
       console.log(msg);
     }
     greeting();
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

221. ### What is the purpose of switch-case

     The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     switch (expression)
     {
         case value1:
             statement1;
             break;
         case value2:
             statement2;
             break;
         .
         .
         case valueN:
             statementN;
             break;
         default:
             statementDefault;
     }
     ```

     The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

223. ### What are primitive data types

     A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

     1. string
     2. number
     3. boolean
     4. null
     5. undefined
     6. bigint
     7. symbol

224. ### What are the different ways to access object properties

     There are 3 possible ways for accessing the property of an object.

     1. **Dot notation:** It uses dot for accessing the properties

     ```javascript
     objectName.property;
     ```

     1. **Square brackets notation:** It uses square brackets for property access

     ```javascript
     objectName["property"];
     ```

     1. **Expression notation:** It uses expression in the square brackets

     ```javascript
     objectName[expression];
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

228. ### What are the different error names from error object

     There are 6 different types of error names returned from error object,
     | Error Name | Description |
     |---- | ---------
     | EvalError | An error has occurred in the eval() function |
     | RangeError | An error has occurred with a number "out of range" |
     | ReferenceError | An error due to an illegal reference|
     | SyntaxError | An error due to a syntax error|
     | TypeError | An error due to a type error |
     | URIError | An error due to encodeURI() |

229. ### What are the various statements in error handling

     Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

     1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
     2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
     3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
     4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

230. ### What are the two types of loops in javascript

     1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
     2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

231. ### What is nodejs

     Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

236. ### What is an event loop

     The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the async function has finished executing the code.
     **Note:** It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

237. ### What is call stack

     Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,

     1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
     2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

     Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

     ```javascript
     function hungry() {
       eatFruits();
     }
     function eatFruits() {
       return "I'm eating fruits";
     }

     // Invoke the `hungry` function
     hungry();
     ```

     The above code processed in a call stack as below,

     1. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
     2. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
     3. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.
     4. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.

241. ### What is an Unary operator

     The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.

     ```javascript
     var x = "100";
     var y = +x;
     console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number

     var a = "Hello";
     var b = +a;
     console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN
     ```

251. ### What is typescript

     TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language. You can install it globally as

     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript
     ```

     Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

     ```typescript
     function greeting(name: string): string {
       return "Hello, " + name;
     }

     let user = "Sudheer";

     console.log(greeting(user));
     ```

     The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

252. ### What are the differences between javascript and typescript

     Below are the list of differences between javascript and typescript,

     | feature             | typescript                            | javascript                                      |
     | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
     | Language paradigm   | Object oriented programming language  | Scripting language                              |
     | Typing support      | Supports static typing                | It has dynamic typing                           |
     | Modules             | Supported                             | Not supported                                   |
     | Interface           | It has interfaces concept             | Doesn't support interfaces                      |
     | Optional parameters | Functions support optional parameters | No support of optional parameters for functions |

253. ### What are the advantages of typescript over javascript

     Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

     1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
     2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
     3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

255. ### What is a constructor method

     The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

     ```javascript
     class Employee {
       constructor() {
         this.name = "John";
       }
     }

     var employeeObject = new Employee();

     console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
     ```

272. ### How do you perform form validation using javascript

     JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted.
     Lets' perform user login in an html form,

     ```html
     <form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
       User name: <input type="text" name="uname" />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     And the validation on user login is below,

     ```javascript
     function validateForm() {
       var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
       if (x == "") {
         alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

273. ### How do you perform form validation without javascript

     You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying the `required` attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.

     ```html
     <form method="post">
       <input type="text" name="uname" required />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     **Note:** Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

274. ### What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation

     The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,

     1. checkValidity(): It returns true if an input element contains valid data.
     2. setCustomValidity(): It is used to set the validationMessage property of an input element.
        Let's take an user login form with DOM validations

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       var userName = document.getElementById("uname");
       if (!userName.checkValidity()) {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
           userName.validationMessage;
       } else {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
           "Entered a valid username";
       }
     }
     ```

287. ### How to get the value from get parameters

     The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters. Remember that you may need to use polyfill or `window.location` to access the URL in older browsers(including IE).

     ```javascript
     let urlString = "http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3"; //window.location.href
     let url = new URL(urlString);
     let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get("z");
     console.log(parameterZ); // 3
     ```

289. ### What is the difference between java and javascript

     Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,
     | Feature | Java | JavaScript |
     |---- | ---- | -----
     | Typed | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language |
     | Paradigm | Object oriented programming | Prototype based programming |
     | Scoping | Block scoped | Function-scoped |
     | Concurrency | Thread based | event based |
     | Memory | Uses more memory | Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web pages |

296. ### What is jQuery

     jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function () {
       // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
       alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
     });
     ```

     **Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

297. ### What is V8 JavaScript engine

     V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
     **Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

298. ### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language

     JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

     ```javascript
     let age = 50; // age is a number now
     age = "old"; // age is a string now
     age = true; // age is a boolean
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

299. ### What is a void operator

     The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined(i.e, without returning value). The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     void expression;
     void expression;
     ```

     Let's display a message without any redirection or reload

     ```javascript
     <a href="javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))">
       Click here to see a message
     </a>
     ```

     **Note:** This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using "void(0)".

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

301. ### How do you create an infinite loop

     You can create infinite loops using for and while loops without using any expressions. The for loop construct or syntax is better approach in terms of ESLint and code optimizer tools,

     ```javascript
     for (;;) {}
     while (true) {}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

303. ### What is the output of below for loops

     ```javascript
     for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
       // global scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }

     for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
       // block scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }
     ```

     The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

     **Explanation:** Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is `4 4 4 4`.

     Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is `0 1 2 3`.

304. ### List down some of the features of ES6

     Below are the list of some new features of ES6,

     1. Support for constants or immutable variables
     2. Block-scope support for variables, constants and functions
     3. Arrow functions
     4. Default parameters
     5. Rest and Spread Parameters
     6. Template Literals
     7. Multi-line Strings
     8. Destructuring Assignment
     9. Enhanced Object Literals
     10. Promises
     11. Classes
     12. Modules

305. ### What is ES6

     ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

306. ### Can I redeclare let and const variables

     No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error

     ```bash
     Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared
     ```

     **Explanation:** The variable declaration with `var` keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.

     ```javascript
     var name = "John";
     function myFunc() {
       var name = "Nick";
       var name = "Abraham"; // Re-assigned in the same function block
       alert(name); // Abraham
     }
     myFunc();
     alert(name); // John
     ```

     The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,

     ```javascript
     let name = "John";
     function myFunc() {
       let name = "Nick";
       let name = "Abraham"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
       alert(name);
     }

     myFunc();
     alert(name);
     ```

307. ### Is const variable makes the value immutable

     No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)

     ```javascript
     const userList = [];
     userList.push("John"); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
     console.log(userList); // ['John']
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

308. ### What are default parameters

     In E5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,

     ```javascript
     //ES5
     var calculateArea = function (height, width) {
       height = height || 50;
       width = width || 60;

       return width * height;
     };
     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```

     The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,

     ```javascript
     //ES6
     var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) {
       return width * height;
     };

     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

309. ### What are template literals

     Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.
     In E6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;
     ```

     In ES5, you need break string like below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
     ```

     **Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

314. ### What is destructuring assignment

     The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
     Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment

     ```javascript
     var [one, two, three] = ["JAN", "FEB", "MARCH"];

     console.log(one); // "JAN"
     console.log(two); // "FEB"
     console.log(three); // "MARCH"
     ```

     and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

     ```javascript
     var { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 32 };

     console.log(name); // John
     console.log(age); // 32
     ```

315. ### What are default values in destructuring assignment

     A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,

     **Arrays destructuring:**

     ```javascript
     var x, y, z;

     [x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];
     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```

     **Objects destructuring:**

     ```javascript
     var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };

     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```

316. ### How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment

     If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

     ```javascript
     var x = 10,
       y = 20;

     [x, y] = [y, x];
     console.log(x); // 20
     console.log(y); // 10
     ```

324. ### What is the output of below spread operator array

     ```javascript
     [..."John Resig"];
     ```

     The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']
     **Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.

331. ### What is the difference between internal and external javascript

     **Internal JavaScript:** It is the source code within the script tag.
     **External JavaScript:** The source code is stored in an external file(stored with .js extension) and referred with in the tag.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

332. ### Is JavaScript faster than server side script

     Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side script. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

333. ### How do you get the status of a checkbox

     You can apply the `checked` property on the selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is `True` means the checkbox is checked otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below,

     ```html
     <input type="checkbox" name="checkboxname" value="Agree" /> Agree the
     conditions<br />
     ```

     ```javascript
     console.log(document.getElementById(‘checkboxname’).checked); // true or false
     ```

     The double tilde operator(~~) is known as double NOT bitwise operator. This operator is going to be a quicker substitute for Math.floor().

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

338. ### What is the purpose of Error object

     The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,

     ```javascript
     new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
     ```

     You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,

     ```javascript
     try {
       if (withdraw > balance)
         throw new Error("Oops! You don't have enough balance");
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e.name + ": " + e.message);
     }
     ```

342. ### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument

     Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function

     ```javascript
     function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       console.log(arguments[0]); // "argument1"
       console.log(arguments[1]); // "argument2"
       console.log(arguments[2]); // "argument3"
     }
     myFunction("argument1", "argument2", "argument3");
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

344. ### How do you combine two or more arrays

     The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
     ```

     Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,

     ```javascript
     var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
     var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
     var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
     console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears
     ```

345. ### What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy

     There are two ways to copy an object,

     **Shallow Copy:**
     Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

     **Example**

     ```javascript
     var empDetails = {
       name: "John",
       age: 25,
       expertise: "Software Developer",
     };
     ```

     to create a duplicate

     ```javascript
     var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
     ```

     if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

     ```javascript
     empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
     ```

     The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

     **Deep copy:**
     A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

     **Example**

     ```javascript
     var empDetails = {
       name: "John",
       age: 25,
       expertise: "Software Developer",
     };
     ```

     Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

     ```javascript
     var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
       name: empDetails.name,
       age: empDetails.age,
       expertise: empDetails.expertise,
     };
     ```

     Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

346. ### How do you create specific number of copies of a string

     The `repeat()` method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification.
     Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,

     ```javascript
     "Hello".repeat(4); // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
     ```

348. ### How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending

     The `trim` method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = "   Hello, Goodmorning!   ";

     console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

     console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     ```

349. ### What is the output of below console statement with unary operator

     Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(+"Hello");
     ```

     The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

351. ### What is a thunk function

     A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

     ```javascript
     const add = (x, y) => x + y;

     const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

     thunk(); // 5
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

352. ### What are asynchronous thunks

     The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

     ```javascript
     function fetchData(fn) {
       fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
         .then((response) => response.json())
         .then((json) => fn(json));
     }

     const asyncThunk = function () {
       return fetchData(function getData(data) {
         console.log(data);
       });
     };

     asyncThunk();
     ```

     The `getData` function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

353. ### What is the output of below function calls

     **Code snippet:**

     ```javascript
     const circle = {
       radius: 20,
       diameter() {
         return this.radius * 2;
       },
       perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
     };
     ```
     
     ```javascript
     console.log(circle.diameter());
     console.log(circle.perimeter());
     ```

     **Output:**

     The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

356. ### What happens with negating an array

     Negating an array with `!` character will coerce the array into a boolean. Since Arrays are considered to be truthy So negating it will return `false`.

     ```javascript
     console.log(![]); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

357. ### What happens if we add two arrays

     If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(["a"] + ["b"]); // "ab"
     console.log([] + []); // ""
     console.log(![] + []); // "false", because ![] returns false.
     ```

358. ### What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values

     If you prepend the additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, undefined, NaN, false, ""), the falsy value converts to a number value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(+null); // 0
     console.log(+undefined); // NaN
     console.log(+false); // 0
     console.log(+NaN); // NaN
     console.log(+""); // 0
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

360. ### How do you remove falsy values from an array

     You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.

     ```javascript
     const myArray = [false, null, 1, 5, undefined];
     myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
     ```

361. ### How do you get unique values of an array

     You can get unique values of an array with the combination of `Set` and rest expression/spread(...) syntax.

     ```javascript
     console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 4, 4, 3])]); // [1, 2, 4, 3]
     ```

362. ### What is destructuring aliases

     Sometimes you would like to have a destructured variable with a different name than the property name. In that case, you'll use a `: newName` to specify a name for the variable. This process is called destructuring aliases.

     ```javascript
     const obj = { x: 1 };
     // Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }
     const { x: otherName } = obj;
     ```

363. ### How do you map the array values without using map method

     You can map the array values without using the `map` method by just using the `from` method of Array. Let's map city names from Countries array,

     ```javascript
     const countries = [
       { name: "India", capital: "Delhi" },
       { name: "US", capital: "Washington" },
       { name: "Russia", capital: "Moscow" },
       { name: "Singapore", capital: "Singapore" },
       { name: "China", capital: "Beijing" },
       { name: "France", capital: "Paris" },
     ];

     const cityNames = Array.from(countries, ({ capital }) => capital);
     console.log(cityNames); // ['Delhi, 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Singapore', 'Beijing', 'Paris']
     ```

366. ### What is the easiest way to convert an array to an object

     You can convert an array to an object with the same data using spread(...) operator.

     ```javascript
     var fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];
     var fruitsObject = { ...fruits };
     console.log(fruitsObject); // {0: "banana", 1: "apple", 2: "orange", 3: "watermelon"}
     ```

367. ### How do you create an array with some data

     You can create an array with some data or an array with the same values using `fill` method.

     ```javascript
     var newArray = new Array(5).fill("0");
     console.log(newArray); // ["0", "0", "0", "0", "0"]
     ```

368. ### What are the placeholders from console object

     Below are the list of placeholders available from console object,

     1. %o — It takes an object,
     2. %s — It takes a string,
     3. %d — It is used for a decimal or integer
        These placeholders can be represented in the console.log as below

     ```javascript
     const user = { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" };
     console.log(
       "Hello %s, your details %o are available in the object form",
       "John",
       user
     ); // Hello John, your details {name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi"} are available in object
     ```

     Yes, it is possible to get and debug HTML elements in the console just like inspecting elements.

     ```javascript
     const element = document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0];
     console.log(element);
     ```

     It prints the HTML element in the console,

376. ### How do you flattening multi dimensional arrays

     Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.

     ```javascript
     const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];
     const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```

     But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

     ```javascript
     function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
       const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
       return flattened.some((item) => Array.isArray(item))
         ? flattenMultiArray(flattened)
         : flattened;
     }
     const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];
     const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```

383. ### How to cancel a fetch request

     Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.
     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,

     1. Create an `AbortController` instance
     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal
        For example, let's pass the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,

     ```javascript
     const controller = new AbortController();
     const { signal } = controller;

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests
     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
     ```

386. ### How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers

     You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.

393. ### What is heap

     Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.
     Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

397. ### How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type

     In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,

     ```javascript
     var myPrimitive = 30;
     var myNonPrimitive = {};
     function isPrimitive(val) {
       return Object(val) !== val;
     }

     isPrimitive(myPrimitive);
     isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);
     ```

     If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.

398. ### What is babel

     Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,

     1. Transform syntax
     2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)
     3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

399. ### Is Node.js completely single threaded

     Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and performance of a program.

402. ### What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration

     The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

     Let's see this difference with an example,

     **Function Constructor:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return new Function("return a;");
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
     ```

     **Function declaration:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return function func() {
         return a;
       };
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200
     ```

404. ### What is the easiest way to resize an array

     The length property of an array is useful to resize or empty an array quickly. Let's apply length property on number array to resize the number of elements from 5 to 2,

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(array.length); // 5

     array.length = 2;
     console.log(array.length); // 2
     console.log(array); // [1,2]
     ```

     and the array can be emptied too

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     array.length = 0;
     console.log(array.length); // 0
     console.log(array); // []
     ```

406. ### What is the difference between function and class declarations

     The main difference between function declarations and class declarations is `hoisting`. The function declarations are hoisted but not class declarations.

     **Classes:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // ReferenceError

     class User {}
     ```

     **Constructor Function:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // No error

     function User() {}
     ```

407. ### What is an async function

     An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

     Let's take a below async function example,

     ```javascript
     async function logger() {
       let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
       console.log(data);
     }
     logger();
     ```

     It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

408. ### How do you prevent promises swallowing errors

     While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

     ```javascript
     Promise.resolve("promised value").then(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       throw new Error("error");
     });
     ```

     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value")
          .then(function () {
            throw new Error("error");
          })
          .catch(function (error) {
            console.error(error.stack);
          });
        ```

        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value").done(function () {
          throw new Error("error");
        });
        ```

        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp()
          .then(function (result) {
            return processDataAsync(result);
          })
          .done(function (processed) {
            displayData(processed);
          });
        ```

        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {
          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
        });
        ```

        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.

     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**
        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections

        ```javascript
        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {
          throw error;
        });
        ```

        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch

        ```javascript
        Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {});
        ```

414. ### What are the differences between arguments object and rest parameter

     There are three main differences between arguments object and rest parameters

     1. The arguments object is an array-like but not an array. Whereas the rest parameters are array instances.
     2. The arguments object does not support methods such as sort, map, forEach, or pop. Whereas these methods can be used in rest parameters.
     3. The rest parameters are only the ones that haven’t been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

415. ### What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter

     Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

417. ### What are the built-in iterables

     Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,

     1. Arrays and TypedArrays
     2. Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points
     3. Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs
     4. Sets: iterates over their elements
     5. arguments: An array-like special variable in functions
     6. DOM collection such as NodeList

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

418. ### What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements

     Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:

     1. for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
     2. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.

     Let's explain this difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     let arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

     arr.newProp = "newVlue";

     // key are the property keys
     for (let key in arr) {
       console.log(key);
     }

     // value are the property values
     for (let value of arr) {
       console.log(value);
     }
     ```

     Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs a, b, c in the console.

420. ### What is the difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?

     1. **isNaN**: The global function `isNaN` converts the argument to a Number and returns true if the resulting value is NaN.
     2. **Number.isNaN**: This method does not convert the argument. But it returns true when the type is a Number and value is NaN.

     Let's see the difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     isNaN(‘hello’);   // true
     Number.isNaN('hello'); // false
     ```

422. ### Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases?

     You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temparature as an example,

     ```js
     const weather = (function getWeather(temp) {
       switch (true) {
         case temp < 0:
           return "freezing";
         case temp < 10:
           return "cold";
         case temp < 24:
           return "cool";
         default:
           return "unknown";
       }
     })(10);
     ```

423. ### What is the easiest way to ignore promise errors?

     The easiest and safest way to ignore promise errors is void that error. This approach is ESLint friendly too.

     ```js
     await promise.catch((e) => void e);
     ```

430. ### How do you reverse an array without modifying original array?

     The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,

     ```javascript
     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const newArray = originalArray.reverse();

     console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

     There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.

     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**
        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**
        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**
        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {
          return [value, ...accumulator];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          return [...accumulator, value];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          accumulator.push(value);
          return accumulator;
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

432. ### What is global execution context?

     The global execution context is the default or first execution context that is created by the JavaScript engine before any code is executed(i.e, when the file first loads in the browser). All the global code that is not inside a function or object will be executed inside this global execution context. Since JS engine is single threaded there will be only one global environment and there will be only one global execution context.

     For example, the below code other than code inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.

     ```javascript
     var x = 10;

     function A() {
       console.log("Start function A");

       function B() {
         console.log("In function B");
       }

       B();
     }

     A();

     console.log("GlobalContext");
     ```

434. ### What is debouncing?

     Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance_. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.

     Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using `clearTimeout` and reschedule API call/DB query for a new time—300 ms in the future.

     ```js
     function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
       let timer;
       return (...args) => {
         clearTimeout(timer);
         timer = setTimeout(() => {
           func.apply(this, args);
         }, timeout);
       };
     }
     function fetchResults() {
       console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
     }
     const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
     ```

     The _debounce()_ function can be used on input, button and window events

     **Input:**

     ```html
     <input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
     ```

     **Button:**

     ```html
     <button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>
     ```

     **Windows event:**

     ```html
     window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);
     ```

435. ### What is throttling?

     Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler function, even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions. The common use cases are browser resizing, window scrolling etc.

     The below example creates a throttle function to reduce the number of events for each pixel change and trigger scroll event for each 100ms except for the first event.

     ```js
     const throttle = (func, limit) => {
       let inThrottle;
       return (...args) => {
         if (!inThrottle) {
           func.apply(this, args);
           inThrottle = true;
           setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
         }
       };
     };
     window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
       throttle(handleScrollAnimation, 100);
     });
     ```

- 2: ReferenceError: X is not defined
- 3: 1, undefined and number
- 4: 1, number and number

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the fist statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.

- 4: 1undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

##### Answer: 2

The important point is that if the statement contains the same operators(e.g, < or >) then it can be evaluated from left to right.
The first statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
2. console.log(true < 3);
3. console.log(1 < 3); // True converted as `1` during comparison
4. True

Whereas the second statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
2. console.log(true > 1);
3. console.log(1 > 1); // False converted as `0` during comparison
4. False

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

As per the comparison algorithm in the ECMAScript specification(ECMA-262), the above expression converted into JS as below

```javascript
10 === Number([10].valueOf().toString()); // 10

##### Answer: 4

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); // true

Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

##### Answer: 4

The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined);
}
```

The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.

Symbol follows below conventions,

1. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.
2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

**Note:** The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.

##### Answer: 4

The return value of `typeof myNumber (OR) typeof myString` is always the truthy value (either "number" or "string"). Since ! operator converts the value to a boolean value, the value of both `!typeof myNumber or !typeof myString` is always false. Hence the if condition fails and control goes to else block.

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});

Spread syntax can be applied only to iterable objects. By default, Objects are not iterable, but they become iterable when used in an Array, or with iterating functions such as `map(), reduce(), and assign()`. If you still try to do it, it still throws `TypeError: obj is not iterable`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 1

A return statement in a generator function will make the generator finish. If a value is returned, it will be set as the value property of the object and done property to true. When a generator is finished, subsequent next() calls return an object of this form: `{value: undefined, done: true}`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.

##### Answer: 4

When a regular or prototype method is called without a value for **this**, the methods return an initial this value if the value is not undefined. Otherwise global window object will be returned. In our case, the initial `this` value is undefined so both methods return window objects.

(function innerFunc() {
  if (count === 10) {

  console.log(count);
})();
```

- 2: 11, 11
- 3: 10, 11
- 4: 10, 10

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

- 3: console.log(true && '' && 0);

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
  
 - 1: hi
 - 2: 1
 - 3: ''
  
 Reason : The operator returns the value of the first falsy operand encountered when evaluating from left to right, or the value of the last operand if they are all truthy.

**Note:** Below these values are consider as falsy value

- 1: 0
- 2: ''

- 3: getMessage is not defined
- 4: Undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above function will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment. So the variables will have undefined value in memory phase and throws an error '`getMessage` is not a function' at the code execution phase.

#### 60. What is the output of below code?

```javascript
let quickPromise = Promise.resolve();

quickPromise.then(() => console.log("promise finished"));

console.log("program finished"); 
```

- 1: program finished
- 2: Cannot predict the order
- 3: program finished, promise finished
- 4: promise finished, program finished

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its **.then/catch/finally** handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.

**Note:** We call the above queue as "MicroTask Queue"

#### 61. What is the output of below code?

- 1: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a new line, and finally print `Third line` as next line
- 2: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a first line, and  print `Third line` as next line
- 3:  Missing semi-colon error
- 4:  Cannot read properties of undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called `Automatic Semicolon Insertion` which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.

```javascript
console.log('First line')['a', 'b', 'c'].forEach((element) => console.log(element))
```

Hence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.

- 3:  SyntaxError: Identifier 'of' has already been declared
- 4:  ReferenceError: of is not defined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

In JavaScript, `of` is not considered as a reserved keyword. So the variable declaration with `of` is accepted and prints the array value `of` using for..of loop.

But if you use reserved keyword such as `in` then there will be a syntax error saying `SyntaxError: Unexpected token in`,

```javascript
var in = ['in'];
for(var in in in) {
  console.log(in[in]);
}
```
